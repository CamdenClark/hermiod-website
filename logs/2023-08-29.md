title: A minimal shell.nix for rust

I have been using NixOS on my home machine and wanted to have a Rust development environment.

It's quite easy to get started I've found:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
  pkgs.mkShell {
    # nativeBuildInputs is usually what you want -- tools you need to run
    nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs.buildPackages; [ 
        pkgs.cargo 
        pkgs.rustc
        pkgs.cargo-watch
    ];
}
```

Fun! I can then do `cargo watch -x run`.
