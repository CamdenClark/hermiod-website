# lspilot

I've had a germ of an idea for a while -- to create a kind of proxy language server that sits between your editor and your normal language server but uses LLMs to superpower them.

It seems like we could do a lot of cool stuff like rank normal lanugage server completions, or step in to provide a completion that we're highly confident is right.

Getting the UX right is tricky. And the setup of all those different language servers could be annoying.

I'm starting with go because it's pretty simple, and has a large enough userbase.

I wrote a basic one that is just a passthrough proxy to the the gopls ls.

i think that's a good starting point.

my next try is to listen to text change evnets and provide a simple completion

# ocaml playground

did some basic stuff with OCaml toplevel
